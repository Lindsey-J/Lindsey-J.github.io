        <h2>Junior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a junior at Bob Jones University studying communication and Ministry & Leadership. I am a missionary kid who grew up in Thailand and has traveled to many different countries.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy making music with the guitar, violin, ukulele, or piano. I am also active in my local church: Heritage Bible Church in Greenville, SC. I play guitar for the college group services, and I also help in the children's ministry.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also love haning out with friends or going on drives.
